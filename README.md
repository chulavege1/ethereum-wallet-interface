Ethereum Wallet Interface
The Ethereum Wallet Interface is a project providing an integration interface with Ethereum wallets. 
This project leverages the power of React, TypeScript, and Webpack, and utilizes libraries such as ethers, @ethersproject/providers, @web3modal/ethereum, and @walletconnect/web3-provider to interface with wallets and conduct transactions.

The application's theme has been generated with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.

Integration with Aave protocol is also incorporated, enabling the retrieval of the token list from Aave and facilitating easy interaction with these tokens.
